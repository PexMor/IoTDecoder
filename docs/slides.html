# Introduction

The idea of decoder came to my mind when I have encountered the page of [pripoj.me](https://pripoj.me/).


That page is a LoRaWab promotion page of Czech Radiocommunications ([ÄŒRa](https://www.cra.cz/)).

The page has list of sensors that are awailable to anyone willing to research and invent new things of which The Next Internet will be made of. Well but there was a small glitch and I did not want to re-invent the wheel.

So I made small [Swiss Army Knife](https://www.amazon.com/Wenger-16999-Swiss-Knife-Giant/dp/B001DZTJRQ) to avoid painful start and bring some automation.
